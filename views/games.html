      <h1>Apexyll</h1>
      <h2>Puzzle Adventure</h2>
      <p class="noMargin">Apexyll is a puzzle platforming adventure game I developed using Stencyl, and it is a flash game. My last flash game.<br/>The player's goal was to hop around this alien environment solving puzzles and playing games on panels to progress. Subtly inspired by The Witness, each panel had a different level from one of two minigames, TOKEN and BitSpace. BitSpace is inspired by one of my previous games Split Space 2017, and TOKEN is just a basic slide puzzle game.<br/><br/>The game was created for Pixel Day 2019. I unfortunately did not get a significant place. This game did mark a good milestone for my skills though. Save files and better options menu.<br/><br/>Warning: this game is has some game-breaking bugs. I didn't perfect the save files, and they will occasionally overwrite eachother. Also dying too much in BitSpace causes lag. I have no plans to fix these for the flash game.<br/><br/>Play it on <a class="nGames" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/725094" target="_blank">Newgrounds</a>.</p>

      <h1>Rotary</h1>
      <h2>Puzzle</h2>
      <p class="noMargin">Rotary is a puzzle game I developed using Stencyl, and it is a flash game.<br/>The players goal was to rotate all rotary (clock) hands so that they point in the same direction. It doesn't matter which.<br/>Differently colored/shaped rotary hands can point differently from others as long as all the hands of the same color/shape point in the same direction. There are a total of 24 levels, 4 of which are challenge levels and much more difficult.<br/><br/>This game is, or at least I consider it to be, the best game I made thus far. Perhaps the music and SFX can be better, but when it comes to the actual game, I think it's fantastatic.<br/><br/>Play it on <a class="nGames" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/698097" target="_blank">Newgrounds</a>.</p>

      <h1>Split Space 2017</h1>
      <h2>Arcade Shooter</h2>
      <p class="noMargin">Split Space 2017 is a vertical scrolling arcade shooter I developed using Stencyl, and it is a flash game.<br/>The player's goal was to defeat the waves of incoming enemies. There are only five waves, but each one was rather lenghty, had a unique sent of enemies and a boss at the end. The game also has a highscore system built into newgrounds which, as of May 5, 2020, I still hold the all-time highscore of 5,700,675 points.<br/><br/>The game was created for the Pixel Day 2017 competition. I, unfortunately, did not earn a podium place, but I did get fourth.<br/><br/>Play it on <a class="nGames" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/687472" target="_blank">Newgrounds</a>.</p>
