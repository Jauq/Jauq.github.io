      <h1>Broken Guns</h1>
      <h2>Arcade Shooter</h2>
      <p class="noMargin">Broken Guns is an arcade run n' gun platforming shooter I developed using Construct 3. It is made in HTML5. My first HTML5 game.<br/>The player takes control of Captain Blue Dude in his goal of protecting his planet by destroying bombs all while defending himself from an army of alien baddies. There are 5 enemy types (yes really).<br/><br/>This game was made in 48 hours (plus 2 hours for bugfixes and newgrounds highscores). The theme was backwards (hence the name the of the game). For what gamejam you ask? None, there is no game jam. This was a test to prepare me for the upcoming GMTK Gamejam 2020. I wanted to test my own game making skills, plus I need to learn how to use Construct 3 better.<br/><br/>Play it on <a class="nGames" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/755250" target="_blank">Newgrounds</a>.</p>

      <h1>Apexyll</h1>
      <h2>Puzzle Adventure</h2>
      <p class="noMargin">Apexyll is a puzzle platforming adventure game I developed using Stencyl. It is a flash game. My last flash game.<br/>The player's goal was to hop around this alien environment solving puzzles and playing games on panels to progress. Subtly inspired by The Witness, each panel had a different level from one of two minigames, TOKEN and BitSpace. BitSpace is inspired by one of my previous games Split Space 2017, and TOKEN is just a basic slide puzzle game.<br/><br/>The game was created for Pixel Day 2019. I unfortunately did not get a significant place. This game did mark a good milestone for my skills though.<br/><br/>Play it on <a class="nGames" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/725094" target="_blank">Newgrounds</a>.</p>

      <h1>Rotary</h1>
      <h2>Puzzle</h2>
      <p class="noMargin">Rotary is a puzzle game I developed using Stencyl. It is a flash game.<br/>The player's goal was to rotate all rotary (clock) hands so that they point in the same direction. It doesn't matter which direction. Some rotary hands become synced and start to affect and rotate eachother. There are a total of 24 levels, 4 of which are challenging levels.<br/><br/>Play it on <a class="nGames" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/698097" target="_blank">Newgrounds</a>.</p>

      <h1>Split Space 2017</h1>
      <h2>Arcade Shooter</h2>
      <p class="noMargin">Split Space 2017 is a vertical scrolling arcade shooter I developed using Stencyl. It is a flash game.<br/>The player's goal was to defeat the waves of incoming enemies. There are only five waves, but each one was rather lenghty, had a unique set of enemies and a boss at the end. The game also has a highscore system built into newgrounds which, as of May 5, 2020, I still hold the all-time highscore of 5,700,675 points.<br/><br/>The game was created for the Pixel Day 2017 competition. I, unfortunately, did not earn a podium place, but I did get fourth.<br/><br/>Play it on <a class="nGames" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/687472" target="_blank">Newgrounds</a>.</p>
