      <p class="noMargin">Here I am planning to show off my skills and passion for music composition. I only do electronic stuff, and prefer minor keys. I'll probably also put my favorite music here just to share and promote. Currently my music is messily placed in 5 different places. Oof. It's that reason why I want to have a single place to put it all. If you want to check some of my stuff out while this page is incomplete I'll list links here: <a class="nMusic" href="https://jauqar.newgrounds.com/audio/" target="_blank">Newgrounds Music</a>, <a class="nMusic" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-884499412" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, <a class="nMusic" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhWgfahDj2DTFa7nx1gtSz-fEWS0s89C3" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.<br/>There won't be any updates to this section for a while. Not because I no longer like music, its just that I can post music stuff on the other websites where all the proper music-ish html stuff is already good.</p>
