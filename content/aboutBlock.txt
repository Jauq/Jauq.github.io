My name is Tim Anfilofieff. I am a creative person and I like to create things. I focus on interactive entertainment, also know as games. Specifically the digital or video kind. I also do graphic design and think I do well, and I also have a passion for character design. Additionally I have composed music of many kinds.
%0 I am well versed in the Ruby programming language and the web development stack (HTML, CSS, JS). I also know a bit of C#, SQL, Python and Lua. I use GitHub for version control. I have some experience with T-Foundation Server. My go to IDE is *6 but I have experience with *7 as well.
