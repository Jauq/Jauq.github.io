Rotary is a puzzle game I developed using Stencyl, and it is a flash game.
The players goal was to rotate all rotary (clock) hands so that they point in the same direction. It doesn't matter which.
Differently colored/shaped rotary hands can point differently from others as long as all the hands of the same color/shape point in the same direction. There are a total of 24 levels, 4 of which are challenge levels and much more difficult.

This game is, or at least I consider it to be, the best game I made thus far. Perhaps the music and SFX can be better, but when it comes to the actual game, I think it's fantastatic.
