Broken Guns is an arcade run n' gun platforming shooter I developed using Construct 3. It is made in HTML5. My first HTML5 game.
The player takes control of Captain Blue Dude in his goal of protecting his planet by destroying bombs all while defending himself from an army of alien baddies. There are 5 enemy types (yes really).

This game was made in 48 hours (plus 2 hours for bugfixes and newgrounds highscores). The theme was backwards (hence the name the of the game). For what gamejam you ask? None, there is no game jam. This was a test to prepare me for the upcoming GMTK Gamejam 2020. I wanted to test my own game making skills, plus I need to learn how to use Construct 3 better.
