Apexyll is a puzzle platforming adventure game I developed using Stencyl, and it is a flash game. My last flash game.
The player's goal was to hop around this alien environment solving puzzles and playing games on panels to progress. Subtly inspired by The Witness, each panel had a different level from one of two minigames, TOKEN and BitSpace. BitSpace is inspired by one of my previous games Split Space 2017, and TOKEN is just a basic slide puzzle game.

The game was created for Pixel Day 2019. I unfortunately did not get a significant place. This game did mark a good milestone for my skills though. Save files and better options menu.

Warning: this game is has some game-breaking bugs. I didn't perfect the save files, and they will occasionally overwrite eachother. Also dying too much in BitSpace causes lag. I have no plans to fix these for the flash game.
