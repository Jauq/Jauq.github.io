Split Space 2017 is a vertical scrolling arcade shooter I developed using Stencyl, and it is a flash game.
The player's goal was to defeat the waves of incoming enemies. There are only five waves, but each one was rather lenghty, had a unique sent of enemies and a boss at the end. The game also has a highscore system built into newgrounds which, as of May 5, 2020, I still hold the all-time highscore of 5,700,675 points.

The game was created for the Pixel Day 2017 competition. I, unfortunately, did not earn a podium place, but I did get fourth.
