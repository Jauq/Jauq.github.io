Here I am planning to show off my skills and passion for music composition. I only do electronic stuff, and prefer minor keys. I'll probably also put my favorite music here just to share and promote. Currently my music is messily placed in 5 different places. Oof. It's that reason why I want to have a single place to put it all. If you want to check some of my stuff out while this page is incomplete I'll list links here: *0, *1, *2, *3, *4. I use the moniker 1Twenty-Cell for some of my music. Also yes, my old music is bad.
