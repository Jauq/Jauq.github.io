      <p class="noMargin">I'm getting close to a presentable version of this. A couple more things to setup for an idea I'm working on and I'll finally replace that old index with this new one. How exciting! In other news, my newest game <a class="nHome" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/755250" target="_blank">Broken Guns</a> just released, go check it out and try to get the highscore.</p>

It isn't done just yet though. Still need to fill it out. While on this topic though, my website's footer now has links to that page. Check it out!</p>

      <p class="noMargin">It has been a while since I last did something important to this site. So here I go using my content generator to make this post. I'd say I did a good job. So far the only thing I've changed was how the Games page reads content. I was going to make a unique way of displaying my games, but then I realized that these content blocks would work well enough.</p>

      <p class="noMargin">Oh, hello there. I didn't see you come in. Please make yourself comfortable. I've prepared cookies and tea, surely you'd like to have some. As you can see, this webpage is called "newindex" that's because it'll eventually replace my previous index page that you probably saw when you first found this website. Unfortunately it won't be replacing it any time soon, there are a lot of things that I need to get working first before I can make that commit. But feel free to enjoy the current styling visible to you at this very moment. Keep in mind though that some of this could change before I complete the project.</p>
