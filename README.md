# Jauq.github.io

Repository needs to be cloned at the root directory in order for the files to function. All local links and references refer to the root directory as a common starting point. The folder that all the files need to be in at the root directory must be named "Jauq.github.io" and nothing else.

The only issue with the way my filepath system is currently set up is the fact that the url duplicates "Jauq.github.io" once. A minimal visual problem, but it could potentially cause problems for me in the future when sharing links. The second one is completely removable manually and the webpage still works fine.
